1. **Participation. (15%)**

   This course requires your active participation in film
   discussions and lecture. All students must participate in discussions
   and as we dissect the films.

2. **Reading Précis. (30%)**
   
   For each assigned reading aside from the text book, students must write
   a research précis to be turned in on the day that reading is assigned.
   Instructions for how to write a research précis are available
   [here](https://chadblack.net/LatAmSport2019/memo/). You do not have to
   write the full memo, but I would encourage you to do so for readings
   that support your final project.

3. **Film Papers. (30%)**
   
   After each pair of films, students will write a 4-6
   page paper critiquing the films using the provided readings. Each paper
   should include a short overview of the plots, the important characters,
   and a discussion of the historical themes that they embody. Then, with
   reference to the readings, evaluate the historic merits of the film.
   Analyze the readings in the context of the film, and the film in the
   context of the readings.

   It is up to you which historical themes you decide to emphasize from
   the theme, but you must be able to connect them to specifics in either
   the primary or secondary readings at your disposal, and the content of
   our lectures and discussions.

4. **Final Project. (25%)**

   For the final project, students will choose a pair of films or
   a television series of their own, assemble a set of readings, and write
   an evaluation patterned on our regular papers.
