# Assignments


1. **Participation and Self-Evaluation. (15%)**

   This course requires your active participation in book
   discussions and lecture. YOU MUST READ WEEKLY FOR THIS CLASS.

2. **Weekly Assignments. (35%)**

    Each week, there will be some type of assignment designed to help you move
    along your research. These may include reading précis, outlines,
    bibliography work, research plans, primary source analyses, etc. Some of
    these are predetermined. Others, I will assign based on how the course is
    going and what your strengths and weaknesses seem to be. So, stay tuned!
   

3. **Final Paper. (50%)**
   
   The paper to end all papers. Students will write a research paper of
   4,500-6,000 words in length. The paper will have a formal bibliography. The topic
   will be of the student’s choosing, and will  analyze broader social or cultural issues, 
   such as gender, race, sport, class, invention, urbanity, work, youth,
   protest, etc. in the context of a Global 1968. Topics can be about the lead
   up to, the crisis, or the aftermath of 1968, conceived broadly. As such,
   topics cannot be exlusively about the United States, but must engage
   a global setting. Topic selection must also come with a primary source base
   that you can work with during the course of the semester.
