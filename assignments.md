# Assignments


1. **Participation and Self-Evaluation. (15%)**

   This course requires your active participation in film
   discussions and lecture. All students must participate in discussions
   and as we dissect the films.

2. **Reading Memos. (25%)**
   
   Students will write weekly reaction papers or research memos each week.  
   Instructions for how to write a research memo are available
   [here](https://chadblack.net/LatAmSport2019/memo/). We will also practice
   writing these types of pieces in groups in class. Due no later than Friday
   night.


3. **Film Papers. (60%)**
   
   After each pair of films, students will write a 4-6
   page paper critiquing the films using the provided readings. Each paper
   should include a short overview of the plots, the important characters,
   and a discussion of the historical themes that they embody. Then, with
   reference to the readings, evaluate the historic merits of the film.
   Analyze the readings in the context of the film, and the film in the
   context of the readings.

   It is up to you which historical themes you decide to emphasize from
   the theme, but you must be able to connect them to specifics in either
   the primary or secondary readings at your disposal, and the content of
   our lectures and discussions.

**Extra credit opportunities:**  

1. Write up current events that connect to our films, themes, etc.  
2. Extra film paper on a film of your choosing.
