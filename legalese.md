# About

Moving pictures have long marveled Latin America. In what was almost
certainly the first demonstration of the technology south of the Rio
Bravo, the [Lumiére
brothers](http://www.earlycinema.com/pioneers/lumiere_bio.html) showed
Mexican President Porfirio Díaz
[flims](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nj0vEO4Q6s) in Chapultepec Castle
in 1896! As moving picture technology spread throughout the world,
including Latin America, it radically altered how individuals and groups
in the region perceived themselves, and were represented by others. Film
(and later television) has been a source of enjoyment, a powerful
propaganda tool, a medium of artistic expression, and a driving force of
national identity. 

In this class, we will focus on portrayals of Indigenous peoples in films from
and about Latin America. In particular, we will use the films to analyze
Indigenous responses to and participation in the historical processes of
modernity. What does it mean to be modern? Who defines the cultures of
modernity and to what end? How have Indigenous people sought autonomy over
their own experiences of modernity?  

While films will be a central component of our approach to the
region's history, course readings will serve as the basis for our
discussion and written evaluations weekly. How has the popular cinema
industry portrayed modern Latin American history? We will watch and
analyze films from the United States, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia,  and
elsewhere that grapple with various aspects of the conundrum of the modern
period.

Most films will be in Spanish with English subtitles. The majority of the
films are rated R for strong language, violence, and/or sexual content.
These topics (sex and violence) are not the main topic of the films, but
are used to convey the struggles and reality of 
contemporary struggles in the twentieth century in. In class we will discuss at
length the themes that go beyond the uninformed viewer’s interpretation of
the film. If, however, you feel uncomfortable with these topics please
come speak to me.

# Course Objectives

1. To read Latin American history, and use the information as a basis for
   media critique.
2. To learn to identify how film mediates, represents the history it
   attempts to visually reconstruct.
3. To learn to synthesize a variety of sources, evaluate them, and
   articulate in written and oral form an argument.

# Policies 


![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Masks:** The University is currently encouraging students, faculty, and staff
to mask indoors. We will comply with this. The Omicron variant of
this virus is extremely contagious.  This turns the classroom into
a potentially high-risk situation. Wearing a mask for 75 minutes indoors is
a small price to pay to be back in University community.

**Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory. If you cannot attend, please email
Dr. Black or your TA ahead of time. We're not making an Inquisition into your
absences, so the reasons you can't attend are not as important as giving us the
heads up. If you have *any* symptoms or have been exposed to COVID, please do
not come to class! Just send us a quick email, and get tested.


**Deadlines:** Assignments must uploaded to Canvas by the end of the day on
which they are due. Late papers will not be accepted with out **prior
arrangement**. If you will not be able to complete an assignment on time, you
must contact me and your TA ahead of time. If you contract COVID or some other
illness, please let us know so that we can work with you.


**Cell Phones, Laptops, Zoom:** Cellphones should be put away during class.
Please do not text or post to the Group Me during class. It is very distracting
to people around you, and to the professor. Laptops may be used to take notes,
but I would ask you to seriously consider using paper instead. If you want or
need to use a laptop, please consider sitting towards the back of the room so
as to minimize distractions behind you. If we have to utilize Zoom at some
point, please practice the kind of respectful manners that I'm sure you have
become used to over the last 15 months. In class and on Zoom, I would invite
you to interrupt me with questions during lecture.

Research shows that analog note-taking improves learning. Consider having paper
with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking-- both while
reading and in class-- leads to substantially better educational outcomes.
Consider taking notes by hand even though you'll be watching on your computer.

**Drop-in Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me and the
TAs outside of class. The advantages include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for exams; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I have an open door policy during my drop-in hours. I will be there, and you
are welcome to come by for any reason. Your TAs have the same. I'm also
available via zoom by appointment.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website. We'll have to
remain flexible as the outlook for our fourth pandemic semester is still
uncertain.
