## Aug. 24: Introduction to the Course

Read: 

* The [Syllabus]() and website.

**DUE:** 

## Aug. 31: One Dimensional Man, Part 1.

In a somewhat surprising twist, the global crises of the late 1960s made
a celebrity out of an aging German cultural theorist who had escaped the Nazi
regime. Herbert Marcuse's most famous book, *One Dimensional Man*, became
a reference text for a decade that aspired to liberation. That same popularity
has made his work still today the object of cultural and political backlash.
What did he say that resonated with youth of the 1960s, while also still
being perceived as threatening to this day? What were his divisive concepts?

Read:  

* Herbert Marcuse, *One Dimensional Man*, pp. 1-83.


**DUE:** 

* A précis of one of the three chapters.



## Sep. 7: One Dimensional Man, Part 2.

Having diagnosed a problem, does Marcuse create a path forward? Is there more
to critical theory than the negation of the present?

**Read:**  

* Herbert Marcuse, *One Dimensional Man*, pp. 84-122; 225-258.

**DUE:**  

* Full research memo on *One Dimensional Man*.

## Sep. 14: Fanon and Guevara

*One Dimensional Man* provides an entry into one vector of critique that
animated the global protests of 1968. It is in the tradition of European
philosophy and critical theory, and centered on themes of alienation,
affluence, technology, bureaucracy, etc. An wholly other context produced
soliarity and action that was less an immanent critique of Europe and the
United States, and more an anti-colonial and anti-capitalist from outside of
Europe and the United States. This week we have two chapters that are examples
of that critique. Franz Fanon's work emerged in the context of both the French
Caribbean and Algeria's struggle for Independence. Che Guevara was a product of
anti-imperialism in the Americas, and particularly in the struggle against US
American hegemony.

**Read:**  

1. Franz Fanon, "Concerning Violence," pp. 35-106 in *Wretched of the Earth*,
   Constance Farrington, trans. (New York: Grove Press, 1963).
2. Ernesto Guevara, ["Socialism and Man in
   Cuba"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm)

* Be ready to brainstorm some potential paper topics, including thinking about
  what kinds of resources you will need for said topics. 


## Sep. 21: Towards 1968 -- Mexico Pt. 1.

It's tempting with a year like 1968, where so much happened of significance, to
work through the year and around the globe in a sort-of de-contextualized
synchronicity. The roots of the events of 1968 were particular to each place,
even as they expressed similar grievances. This week, we look at particular
roots in Mexico in the decades before 1968, and that year's associations with
the counterculture (*La Onda*) and student agitation that preceded it.

**Read:**

1. Eric Zolov, *Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture*
   (University of California Press, 1999), pp. 1-92.


**DUE:**  

* Précis and notes on Zolov.


## Sep. 28: Towards 1968 -- Mexico Part 2. 

In addition to Zolov's account of *La Onda* and 1968, this week we'll also be
thinking about the particular global context of Mexico City that year, as
a showcase of statecraft and sportwashing. 

**Read:**  

1. Eric Zolov, *Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture*
   (University of California Press, 1999), pp. 93-166.


**DUE:**  

* A finalized topic in one paragraph.
* A précis for Zolov.
