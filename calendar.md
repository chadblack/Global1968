**DUE:** 

## Aug. 31: One Dimensional Man, Part 1.

In a somewhat surprising twist, the global crises of the late 1960s made
a celebrity out of an aging German cultural theorist who had escaped the Nazi
regime. Herbert Marcuse's most famous book, *One Dimensional Man*, became
a reference text for a decade that aspired to liberation. That same popularity
has made his work still today the object of cultural and political backlash.
What did he say that resonated with youth of the 1960s, while also still
being perceived as threatening to this day? What were his divisive concepts?

## Sep. 7: One Dimensional Man, Part 2.

Having diagnosed a problem, does Marcuse create a path forward? Is there more
to critical theory than the negation of the present?
